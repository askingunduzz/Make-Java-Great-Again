# Make-Java-Great-Again
Our team participated in Global Game Jam 2023, and within 48 hours, we created a Java game.


# Super Mario Bros Java Project

This project is made for CMPE114 Java project in a freshman year on TED University. This game has 3 levels, live-coin-score-timer system, mobs like goombas and koopas, pipes, main menu system, presentation mode system for restricting access to other levels and collision detection system which can be buggy sometimes. 

## Video

I edited a video for showing the evolution of this Mario game project in days. You can watch it from down below.
