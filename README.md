# Make Java Great Again!
We participated in Global Game Jam 2023, and after some effort, here is our final game.

We named our game after discovering how Java was being excluded in terms of gaming. We believe, Java should still have a value among other gaming tools. And we're here to make Java great again!

Our game is mainly a maze game, which has 3 smaller games embedded in it; Snake, Flappy Bird, Root. Our player in the maze is a villian and wants to harm the roots of the trees. If it can make it to the finish line, it will win, and all the trees will die. 
The 3 games included in the maze are places that our character will have to go through, in order to continue its evil dream. 
We wish you a bad luck so that you don't end the world!

We also made a trailer video for our game. You can watch it from down below.
