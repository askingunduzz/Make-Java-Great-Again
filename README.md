# Make Java Great Again!

This project is made for CMPE114 Java project in a freshman year on TED University.  

We named our game after discovering how Java was being excluded in terms of gaming. We believe, Java should still have a value among other gaming tools. And we're here to make Java great again!

Our game is mainly a maze game, which has 3 smaller games embedded in it; Snake, Flappy Bird, Root. Our player in the maze is a villian and wants to harm the roots of the trees. If it can make it to the finish line, it will win, and all the trees will die. 
The 3 games included in the maze are places that our character will have to go through, in order to continue its evil dream. 
We wish you a bad luck so that you don't end the world!

We also made a trailer video for our game. You can watch it from down below.
